        <h1>Cleric</h1>
        <p>
          Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf
          begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his
          battle-worn companions. Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his
          axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against
          him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe’s fall. Calling down a
          curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as
          light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her
          companions. Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and
          the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve,
          clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary
          priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Healers and Warriors</h2>
        <p>
          Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing
          from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power,
          manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power
          to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high
          calling. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A
          cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the
          ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive
          sense of a deity’s wishes. Clerics combine the helpful magic of
          healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder
          foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison,
          and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For
          those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics
          depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the
          power of the gods on their side.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Divine Agents</h2>
        <p>
          Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some
          priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out
          their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and
          strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political
          office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority
          and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in
          most hierarchies. When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is
          usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the
          gods often involves braving dangers in unsettled lands, smiting evil,
          or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also
          expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting
          enemy raiders, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a
          portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world. Most
          adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples
          and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or
          a high priest might be in a position to demand it.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Cleric</h2>
        <p>
          As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is
          which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to
          embody. The Gods of the Multiverse section includes lists of many of
          the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities
          are in your campaign. Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your
          cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service
          willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with
          no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith
          regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate
          goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you
          striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or
          Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.
        </p>

        <h4>Cantrips</h4>
        <p>
          At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric
          spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at
          higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric
          table.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
        <p>
          The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
          cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells,
          you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
          expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list
          of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the
          cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells
          equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one
          spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
          For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level
          and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of
          prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
          combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can
          cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
          remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list
          of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list
          of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at
          least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
        <p>
          Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power
          of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your
          Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
          addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
          DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
          one. <br /><br />
          Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
          <br /><br />
          Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
          <br /><br />
          Ritual Casting <br />
          You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
          tag and you have the spell prepared. <br /><br />
          Spellcasting Focus <br />
          You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
          spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Divine Domain</h3>
        <p>
          Choose one domain related to your deity. Your choice grants you domain
          spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also
          grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that
          feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th
          levels.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Domain Spells</h4>
        <p>
          Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain
          at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a
          domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count
          against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a
          domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell
          is nonetheless a cleric spell for you
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
        <p>
          At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly
          from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start
          with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your
          domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
          levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel
          Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a
          short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel
          Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect
          from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at
          6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and
          beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests.
          When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h4>
        <p>
          As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
          censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30
          feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its
          saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
          A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
          you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet
          of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only
          the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
          moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
          action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Destroy Undead</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against
          your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its
          challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the
          Destroy Undead table.
        </p>

        </table>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Divine Intervention</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on
          your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity’s aid
          requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and
          roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your
          cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the
          intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell
          would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this
          feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you
          finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds
          automatically, no roll required.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Divine Domains</h2>
        <p>
          In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of
          mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains
          over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For
          example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of
          Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your
          deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to
          that domain. Your choice might correspond to a particular sect
          dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in
          one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, emphasizing his influence
          over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius
          (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain.
          Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of
          personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.
          Each domain’s description gives examples of deities who have influence
          over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten
          Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well
          as from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Light Domain</h3>
        <p>
          Gods of light — including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the
          Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty — promote the ideals of
          rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the
          symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself
          or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are
          tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through
          every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach
          that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement. Clerics of a god of
          light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of
          their gods’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and
          burning away darkness.
        </p>

        <h4>Bonus Cantrip</h4>
        <p>
          When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the light cantrip
          if you don’t already know it. This cantrip doesn’t count against the
          number of cleric cantrips you know.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Warding Flare</h4>
        <p>
          Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and
          an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet
          of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose
          disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the
          attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded
          is immune to this feature. You can use this feature a number of times
          equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all
          expended uses when you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness
          sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.
          As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness
          within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile
          creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw.
          A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a
          failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A
          creature that has total cover from you is not affected.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Improved Flare</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 6th level, you can also use your Warding Flare feature
          when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a
          creature other than you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Potent Spellcasting</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you
          deal with any cleric cantrip.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Corona of Light</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate an aura of
          sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another
          action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30
          feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage
          on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Nature Domain</h3>
        <p>
          Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from
          inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai,
          Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with
          particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature
          as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious
          rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret
          tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who
          take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular
          nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that
          despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither
          the crops of those who anger their gods.

        <h4>Acolyte of Nature</h4>
        <p>
          At 1st level, you learn one druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip
          counts as a cleric cantrip for you, but it doesn’t count against the
          number of cleric cantrips you know. You also gain proficiency in one
          of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or
          Survival.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>
        <p>Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to charm
          animals and plants. As an action, you present your holy symbol and
          invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can
          see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the
          creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or
          until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to
          you and other creatures you designate.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Dampen Elements</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you
          takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your
          reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of
          the damage.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Divine Strike</h4>
        <p>
          At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
          divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with
          a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold,
          fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach
          14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Master of Nature</h4>
        <p>
          At 17th level, you gain the ability to command animals and plant
          creatures. While creatures are charmed by your Charm Animals and
          Plants feature, you can take a bonus action on your turn to verbally
          command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>War Domain</h3>
        <p>
          War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It
          can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice
          eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the
          gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds.
          The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight
          the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war
          include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and
          Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as
          Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and
          domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods
          (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance,
          promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any
          circumstance.

        <p>
          From 1st level, your god delivers bolts of inspiration to you while
          you are engaged in battle. When you use the Attack action, you can
          make one weapon attack as a bonus action. You can use this feature a
          number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You
          regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Channel Divinity: Guided Strike</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to strike
          with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use
          your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this
          choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the
          attack hits or misses.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Channel Divinity: War God’s Blessing</h4>
        <p>
          At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack
          roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to
          the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you
          see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or
          misses.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Divine Strike</h4>
        <p>
          At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
          divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with
          a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage
          of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach
          14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
        </p>
