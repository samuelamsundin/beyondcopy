        <h1>Barbarian</h1>
        <p>
          A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and
          hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who
          dared poach his people’s elk herd. A half-orc snarls at the latest
          challenger to her authority over their tribe, ready to break his neck
          with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals. Frothing at the
          mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then
          turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another. These
          barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage:
          unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere
          emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the
          unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For
          some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits.
          Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain.
          For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle
          frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Primal Instinct</h2>
        <p>
          People of towns and cities take pride in their settled ways, as if
          denying one’s connection to nature were a mark of superiority. To a
          barbarian, though, a settled life is no virtue, but a sign of
          weakness. The strong embrace nature—valuing keen instincts, primal
          physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when
          hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their
          homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live
          and hunt. <br />
          Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk
          state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and
          resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few
          times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to
          defeat whatever threats arise.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>A Life of Danger</h2>
        <p>
          A barbarian plays an important role as a protector of their people and
          a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is
          fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying
          monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their
          people don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes
          barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way
          of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the
          adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss
          the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find
          them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their
          adventuring parties.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Creating a Barbarian</h3>
        <p>
          When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character
          comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about
          an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant
          land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the
          campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are
          common? What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured
          to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with
          soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an
          invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless
          refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to
          another land and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have
          been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a
          taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of
          authority.
        </p>
        <h4>Quick Build</h4>
        <p>
          You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions.
          First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by
          Constitution. Second, choose the outlander background.
        </p>

        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>
          You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
          granted by your background:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>

          <li>An expolers pack and four javelins</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Rage</h3>
        <p>
          In battle you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter
          a rage as a bonus action <br />
          While raging you gain the following benefits if you are'nt wearing any
          armor:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            You have advantage on Strenght checks and Strenght saving throws.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you make a melee weapon attack using Strenght, you gain a bonus
            to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian,
            as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concetrate on
          them while raging. Your rage lasts for one minute. It ends early if
          you are knocked unconsious or if your turn ends and you haven't
          attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since
          then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once
          you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in
          the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest
          before you can rage again.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Unarmored Defense</h3>
        <p>
          While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your
          Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield
          and still gain this benefit
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Reckless Attack</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to
          attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on
          your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you
          advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
          turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next
          turn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Danger Sense</h3>
        <p>
          At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t
          as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.
          You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you
          can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be
          blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Primal Path</h3>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.
          Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th,
          and 14th levels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
          whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Fast Movement</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you
          aren’t wearing heavy armor.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Feral Instinct</h3>
        <p>
          By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on
          initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning
          of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first
          turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on
          that turn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Brutal Critical</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die
          when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee
          attack. This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three
          additional dice at 17th level.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Relentless Rage</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite
          grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and
          don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If
          you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this
          feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a
          short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Brutal Critical</h3>
        <p>
          At 13th level, you can roll two additional weapon damage dice when
          determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
          This increases to three additional dice at 17th level.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Persistent Rage</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early
          only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Brutal Critical</h3>
        <p>
          At 17th level, you can roll three additional weapon damage dice when
          determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Indomitable Might</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less
          than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the
          total.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Primal Champion</h3>
        <p>
          At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and
          Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is
          now 24.
        </p>

        <h2>Primal Paths</h2>
        <p>
          Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or
          her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to
          different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir
          where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel.
          Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Path of the Ancestral Guardian</h2>
        <p>
          Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These
          tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as
          mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian
          who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world
          and calls on these guardian spirits for aid. Barbarians who draw on
          their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and
          their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians,
          barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos
          that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of
          victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.
        </p>

        <h3>Ancestral Protectors</h3>
        <p>
          Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors
          appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first
          creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the
          warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn,
          that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against
          you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an
          attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the
          attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Spirit Shield</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide
          supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and
          another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you
          can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6. When you reach
          certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by
          3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Consult the Spirits</h3>
        <p>
          At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral
          spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell,
          without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than
          creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly
          summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom
          is your spellcasting ability for these spells. After you cast either
          spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a
          short or long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Vengeful Ancestors</h3>
        <p>
          At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to
          retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an
          attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the
          damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Path of the Berserker</h2>
        <p>
          For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being
          violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury,
          slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the
          chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Frenzy</h3>
        <p>
          Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a
          frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you
          can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of
          your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level
          of exhaustion.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Mindless Rage</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while
          raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the
          effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Intimidating Presence</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone
          with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that
          you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear
          you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
          proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you
          until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your
          action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
          creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the
          creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away
          from you. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use
          this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Retaliation</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is
          within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon
          attack against that creature.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Path of the Zealot</h2>
        <p>
          Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots — warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power. A variety of gods across the worlds of D&D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.
        </p>

        <h3>Divine Fury</h3>
        <p>
          Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Warrior of the Gods</h3>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as raise dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need material components to cast the spell on you.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Fanatical Focus</h3>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while you’re raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Zealous Presence</h3>
        <p>At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Rage beyond Death</h3>
        <p>Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows. While you’re raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.</p>
