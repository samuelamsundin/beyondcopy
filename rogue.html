        <h1>Rogue</h1>
        <p>
          Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward
          through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls
          out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she
          disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to
          kick the door open. A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
          accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target — a
          notorious slaver — passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the
          slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat
          before he can make a sound. Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her
          fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a
          moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and
          her companions are free to make their escape. Rogues rely on skill,
          stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any
          situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about
          any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is
          the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Skill and Precision</h2>
        <p>
          Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of
          skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a
          broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus
          on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help
          them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming
          traps, and opening locks. When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize
          cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise
          strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most,
          than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an
          almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical
          tricks to supplement their other abilities.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>A Shady Living</h2>
        <p>
          Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to
          the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars,
          assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are
          organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues
          operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to
          help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest
          living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a
          dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the
          sewers. As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are
          hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure
          hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the
          law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit
          purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of
          treasure.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Rogue</h2>
        <p>
          As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s
          relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are
          you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or
          did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards?
          Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire
          or ideal? What was the trigger that led you away from your previous
          life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to
          reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery
          gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did
          wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly
          found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to
          find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another
          member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for
          earning a living and employing your particular talents.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your
          next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up
          the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to
          emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the
          charlatan background.
        </p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>
          You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
          granted by your background:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>(a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword</li>
          <li>(a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword</li>
          <li>
            (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an explorer’s
            pack
          </li>
          <li>Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your
          skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your
          proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
          either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two
          more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain
          this benefit.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Sneak Attack</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a
          foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to
          one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the
          attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You
          don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target
          is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t
          have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage
          increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak
          Attack column of the Rogue table.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Thieves’ Cant</h3>
        <p>
          During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of
          dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in
          seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows
          thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to
          convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In
          addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to
          convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or
          the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether
          the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for
          thieves on the run.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Cunning Action</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to
          move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your
          turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash,
          Disengage, or Hide action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Roguish Archetype</h3>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise
          of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class
          description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants
          you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with
          an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage
          against you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          At 6th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies, or one more
          of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools.
          Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that
          uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Evasion</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain
          area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice
          storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
          make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead
          take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half
          damage if you fail.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Reliable Talent</h3>
        <p>
          By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach
          perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your
          proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Blindsense</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the
          location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Slippery Mind</h3>
        <p>
          By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain
          proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Elusive</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain
          the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you
          while you aren’t incapacitated.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Stroke of Luck</h3>
        <p>
          At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need
          to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss
          into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat
          the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
          again until you finish a short or long rest.

        <h2>Roguish Archetypes</h2>
        <p>
          Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on
          perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat,
          and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer
          those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes.
          Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily
          an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your
          preferred techniques.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Assassin</h3>
        <p>
          You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to
          this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and
          even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of
          their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your
          foes with deadly efficiency.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
        <p>
          When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
          the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Assassinate</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop
          on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any
          creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any
          hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Infiltration Expertise</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for
          yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the
          history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can’t
          establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you
          might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and
          official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a
          trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into
          the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the
          new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that
          person until given an obvious reason not to.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Impostor</h4>
        <p>
          At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another
          person’s speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three
          hours studying these three components of the person’s behavior,
          listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.
          Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature
          suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma
          (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Death Strike</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you
          attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a
          Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your
          proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack
          against the creature.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Inquisitive</h3>
        <p>
          As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting out secrets and
          unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also
          on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other
          creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating
          creatures that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your
          mastery of lore and your keen deductions make you well equipped to
          expose and end hidden evils.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <br /><br />
        <h4>Ear for Deceit</h4>
        <p>
          When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you develop a talent for
          picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to
          determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on
          the d20 as an 8.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Eye for Detail</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom
          (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an
          Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Insightful Fighting</h4>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent’s tactics
          and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you can make a
          Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn’t
          incapacitated, contested by the target’s Charisma (Deception) check.
          If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even
          if you don’t have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have
          disadvantage on it. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you
          successfully use this feature against a different target.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Steady Eye</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception)
          or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you move no more than half
          your speed on the same turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Unerring Eye</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning at 13th level, your senses are almost impossible to foil. As
          an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in
          their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses
          within 30 feet of you, provided you aren’t blinded or deafened. You
          sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no
          insight into what is hidden or into its true nature. You can use this
          feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of
          once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long
          rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Eye for Weakness</h4>
        <p>
          At 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature’s weaknesses by
          carefully studying its tactics and movement. While your Insightful
          Fighting feature applies to a creature, your Sneak Attack damage
          against that creature increases by 3d6.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Thief</h3>
        <p>
          You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits,
          cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so
          do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure
          seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to
          improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for
          delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using
          magic items you normally couldn’t employ.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Fast Hands</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your
          Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your
          thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
          Object action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Second-Story Work</h4>
        <p>
          When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
          climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.
          In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover
          increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Supreme Sneak</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth)
          check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Use Magic Device</h4>
        <p>
          By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic
          that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not
          intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements
          on the use of magic items.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Thief’s Reflexes</h4>
        <p>
          When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes
          and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first
          round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal
          initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t
          use this feature when you are surprised.
