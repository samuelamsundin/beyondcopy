        <h1>Fighter</h1>
        <p>
          A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she
          runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded
          leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his
          exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two
          combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage. A dwarf in
          chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his
          companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf
          in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she
          circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses. A
          gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and
          net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s
          delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares
          with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth
          to smite him. All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most
          diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons and Dragons.
          Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot
          soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all
          share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough
          knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with
          death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Well-Rounded Specialists</h2>
        <p>
          Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can
          swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword,
          use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill.
          Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor.
          Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
          certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting
          with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills
          with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive
          specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and
          in dungeons alike.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Trained for Danger</h2>
        <p>
          Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the
          queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively
          untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran
          soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights,
          and similar figures are fighters. Some fighters feel drawn to use
          their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying,
          and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for
          a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind.
          There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few
          fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic
          flame tongue sword, for example.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Fighter</h2>
        <p>
          As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your
          character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and
          what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you
          particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps
          because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this
          training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for
          revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors. You
          might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local
          militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy,
          tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished
          but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the
          limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family
          tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might
          have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped
          and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your
          most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and
          death’s embrace.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on
          whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse
          weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or
          Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial
          archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.
        </p>

          of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more
          than once, even if you later get to choose again.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Archery</h4>
        <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Defense</h4>
        <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 to AC</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Dueling</h4>
        <p>
          When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
          you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Great Weapon Fighting</h4>
        <p>
          When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a
          melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the
          die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The
          weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain
          this benefit.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Protection</h4>
        <p>
          When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is
          within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage
          on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>
        <p>
          When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability
          modifier to the damage of the second attack.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Second Wind</h3>
        <p>
          You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect
          yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain
          hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this
          feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
          again.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Action Surge</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits
          for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once
          you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you
          can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before
          a rest, but only once on the same turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Martial Archetype</h3>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in
          your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or
          Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The
          archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at
          7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and
          19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
          you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,
          you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using
          the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a
          feat of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
          whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of
          attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and
          to four when you reach 20th level in this class.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Indomitable</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail.
          If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this
          feature again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature
          twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times
          between long rests starting at 17th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 11th level, you can attack three times, instead of twice,
          whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of
          attacks increases to four when you reach 20th level in this class.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
        <p>
          At 20th level, you can attack four times, instead of three, whenever
          you take the Attack action on your turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Martial Archetypes</h2>
        <p>
          Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their
          fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects
          your approach.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Champion</h3>
        <p>
          The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical
          power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this
          archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal
          devastating blows.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Improved Critical</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon
          attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Remarkable Athlete</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round
          up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that
          doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus. In addition, when you make
          a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number
          of feet equal to your Strength modifier.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Additional Fighting Style</h4>
        <p>
          At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style
          class feature.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Superior Critical</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a
          roll of 18–20.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Survivor</h4>
        <p>
          At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the
          start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your
          Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points
          left. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Eldritch Knight</h3>
        <p>
          The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to
          all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use
          magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus
          their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and
          evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional
          protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at
          once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat. These knights learn a
          comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory

        <h5>Cantrips</h5>
        <p>
          You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You
          learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Spell Slots</h5>
        <p>
          The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you
          have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one
          of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or
          higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long
          rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a
          1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield
          using either slot.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h5>
        <p>
          You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
          you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard
          spell list. The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight
          Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st
          level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or
          evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you
          have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this
          class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. The spells you
          learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
          Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the
          wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the
          wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have
          spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless
          you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level
          from any school of magic.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
        <p>
          Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,
          since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use
          your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
          ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
          the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an
          attack roll with one. <br /><br />
          Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
          modifier <br /><br />
          Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
          modifier
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Weapon Bond</h4>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between
          yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1
          hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within
          your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch
          the weapon and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a weapon to
          yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are
          incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon
          that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport
          instantly to your hand. You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can
          summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to
          bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the
          other two.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>War Magic</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip,
          you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Eldritch Strike</h4>
        <p>
          At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a
          creature’s resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a
          weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw
          it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Arcane Charge</h4>
        <p>
          At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an
          unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can
          teleport before or after the additional action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Improved War Magic</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you
          can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Gunslinger</h3>
        <p>
          Most warriors and combat specialists spend their years perfecting the
          classic arts of swordplay, archery, or pole arm tactics. Whether
          duelist or infantry, martial weapons were seemingly perfected long
          ago, and the true challenge is to master them. However, some minds
          couldn’t stop with the innovation of the crossbow. Experimentation
          with alchemical components and rare metals have unlocked the secrets
          of controlled explosive force. The few who survive these trials of
          ingenuity may become the first to create, and deftly wield, the first
          firearms. This archetype focuses on the ability to design, craft, and
          utilize powerful, yet dangerous ranged weapons. Through creative
          innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on
          the battlefield. However, not being a perfect science, firearms carry
          an inherent instability that can occasionally leave you without a
          functional means of attack. This is the danger of new, untested
          technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the
          elements are ever present. Should this path of powder, fire, and metal
          call to you, keep your wits about you, hold on to your convictions as
          a fighter, and let skill meet luck to guide your bullets to strike
          true.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Firearm Proficiency</h4>
        <p>
          Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
          proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus
          to attacks made with firearms.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Gunsmith</h4>
        <p>
          Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
          Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost,
          repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s
          discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are
          only available through crafting.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Firearm Properties</h5>
        <p>
          Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their
          own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a
          number, and this number signifies an element of that property
          (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented
          in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.
          <br /><br />
          Reload. The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload
          score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must
          have one free hand to reload a firearm. <br /><br />
          Misfire. Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice
          roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon
          misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until
          you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you
          must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire
          score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended
          out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who
          use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire
          score by 1. <br /><br />
          Explosive. Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make
          a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus +
          your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon
          misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly
          before doing so.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Ammunition</h5>
        <p>
          All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their
          rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase.
          However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself
          using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own
          unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed
          below next to the price.

        <h4>Adept Marksman</h4>
        <p>
          When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to perform
          powerful trick shots to disable or damage your opponents using your
          firearms. <br /><br />
          Trick Shots. You learn two trick shots of your choice, which are
          detailed under “Trick Shots” below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack
          in some way. Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the
          attack roll is made. You can use only one trick shot per attack.
          <br /><br />
          You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th,
          and 18th level. Each time you learn a new trick shot, you can also
          replace one trick shot you know with a different one. <br /><br />
          Grit. You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier
          (minimum of 1). You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a
          20 on the d20 roll for an attack with a firearm, or deal a killing
          blow with a firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM’s
          discretion). You regain all expended grit points after a short or long
          rest. <br /><br />
          Saving Throws. Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a
          saving throw to resist the trick shot’s effects. The saving throw DC
          is calculated as follows: <br /><br />
          Trick Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity
          modifier
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Quickdraw</h4>
        <p>
          When you reach 7th level, you add your proficiency bonus to your
          initiative. You can also stow a firearm, then draw another firearm as
          a single object interaction on your turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Rapid Repair</h4>
        <p>
          Upon reaching 10th level, you learn how to quickly attempt to fix a
          jammed gun. You can spend a grit point to attempt to repair a misfired
          (but not broken) firearm as a bonus action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Lightning Reload</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 15th level, you can reload any firearm as a bonus action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Vicious Intent</h4>
        <p>
          At 18th level, your firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of
          19-20, and you regain a grit point on a roll of 19 or 20 on a d20
          attack roll.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Hemorrhaging Critical</h4>
        <p>
          Upon reaching 18th level, whenever you score a critical hit on an
          attack with a firearm, the target additionally suffers half of the
          damage from the attack at the end of its next turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Trick Shots</h4>
        <p>These trick shots are presented in alphabetical order.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Bullying Shot</h5>
        <p>
          You can use the powerful blast and thundering sound of your firearm to
          shake the resolve of a creature. You can expend one grit point while
          making a Charisma (Intimidation) check to gain advantage on the roll.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Dazing Shot</h5>
        <p>
          When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one
          grit point to attempt to dizzy your opponent. On a hit, the creature
          suffers normal damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or
          suffer disadvantage on attacks until the end of their next turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Deadeye Shot</h5>
        <p>
          When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one
          grit point to gain advantage on the attack roll.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Disarming Shot</h5>
        <p>
          When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one
          grit point to attempt to shoot an object from their hands. On a hit,
          the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a Strength
          saving throw or drop 1 held object of your choice and have that object
          be pushed 10 feet away from you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Forceful Shot</h5>
        <p>
          When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one
          grit point to attempt to trip them up and force them back. On a hit,
          the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a Strength
          saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Piercing Shot</h5>
        <p>
          When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one
          grit point to attempt to fire through multiple opponents. The initial
          attack gains a +1 to the firearm’s misfire score. On a hit, the
          creature suffers normal damage and you make an attack roll with
          disadvantage against every creature in a line directly behind the
          target within your first range increment. Only the initial attack can
          misfire.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Violent Shot</h5>
        <p>
          When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one
          or more grit points to enhance the volatility of the attack. For each
          grit point expended, the attack gains a +2 to the firearm’s misfire
          score. If the attack hits, you can roll one additional weapon damage
          die per grit point spent when determining the damage.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Winging Shot</h5>
        <p>
          When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one
          grit point to attempt to topple a moving target. On a hit, the
          creature suffers normal damage and must make a Strength saving throw
          or be knocked prone.
