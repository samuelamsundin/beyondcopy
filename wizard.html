        <h1>Wizard</h1>
        <p>
          Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her
          eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her
          quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell
          and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it
          erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers. Checking and
          rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in
          chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along
          every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones
          a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing
          a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond. Crouching on
          the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small
          bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power
          over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods
          slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.
          Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the
          spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates
          the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning,
          subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
          monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns
          slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance
          into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other
          worlds.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Scholars of the Arcane</h2>
        <p>
          Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic
          draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become
          like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical
          spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting
          gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these
          surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years
          of apprenticeship and countless hours of study. Wizards live and die
          by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells
          as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them
          from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from
          ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>The Lure of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to
          come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library
          or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other
          wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or
          pursue lives of crime or domination. But the lure of knowledge and
          power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of
          their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost
          cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient
          civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages,
          and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater
          than any magic available in the present age.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Wizard</h2>
        <p>
          Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least
          one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into
          contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it?
          Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and
          practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an
          ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic? What drew you forth
          from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge
          leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret
          repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps
          you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in
          the face of danger.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by
          Constitution or Dexterity. If you plan to join the School of
          Enchantment, make Charisma your next-best score. Second, choose the
          sage background. Third, choose the mage hand, light, and ray of frost
          cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your
          spellbook: burning hands, charm person, feather fall, mage armor,
          magic missile, and sleep.

        <h4>Cantrips</h4>
        <p>
          At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard
          spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at
          higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard
          table.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellbook</h4>
        <p>
          At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard
          spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
          spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
        <p>
          The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
          wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells,
          you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
          expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list
          of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose
          a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your
          Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The
          spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example,
          if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two
          2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of
          prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
          combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
          spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level
          slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared
          spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a
          long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent
          studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures
          you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for
          each spell on your list.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
        <p>
          Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,
          since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.
          You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
          ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
          the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an
          attack roll with one. <br /><br />
          Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
          modifier <br /><br />
          Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
          modifier
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
        <p>
          You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
          tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have
          the spell prepared.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
        <p>
          You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard
          spells.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
        <p>
          Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of
          your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be
          of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard
          table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can
          add to your spellbook.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Your Spellbook</h4>
        <p>
          The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect
          the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
          breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You
          might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a
          spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or
          in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Copying a Spell into the Book</h5>
        <p>
          When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to
          your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you
          can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into
          your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then
          deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote
          it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or
          gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your
          own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours
          and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as
          you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks
          you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you
          can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Replacing the Book</h5>
        <p>
          You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for
          example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is
          just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and
          easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to
          cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of
          the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same
          procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new
          spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to
          find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards
          keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>The Book’s Appearance</h5>
        <p>
          Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own
          decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain,
          functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your
          master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient
          library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after
          you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Arcane Recovery</h3>
        <p>
          You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying
          your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can
          choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
          combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level
          (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For
          example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two
          levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell
          slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Arcane Tradition</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your
          practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration,
          Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy,
          or Transmutation. The School of Evocation is detailed at the end of
          the class description, and more choices are available in other
          sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at
          6th, 10th, and 14th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Spell Mastery</h3>
        <p>
          At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that
          you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a
          2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those
          spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
          have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher
          level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in
          study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for
          different spells of the same levels.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Signature Spells</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells
          and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard
          spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have
          these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells
          you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level
          without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again
          until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either
          spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Arcane Traditions</h2>
        <p>
          The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest
          mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of
          D&D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. The most
          common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools
          of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells,
          grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in
          chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a
          wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies
          across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the
          schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties
          competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices
          in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into
          schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require
          mastery of different techniques.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>School of Divination</h3>
        <p>
          As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability
          to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some
          enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their
          arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who
          magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall
          somewhere in between.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Divination Savant</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
          you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is
          halved.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Portent</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the
          future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long
          rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any
          attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature
          that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose
          to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only
          once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you
          finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Expert Divination</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to
          you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When
          you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot,
          you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a
          level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher than 5th
          level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>The Third Eye</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your
          powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following
          benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short
          or long rest. You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.
          <br /><br />

          Darkvision. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
          <br /><br />

          Ethereal Sight. You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of
          you. <br /><br />

          Greater Comprehension. You can read any language. <br /><br />

          See Invisibility. You can see invisible creatures and objects within
          10 feet of you that are within line of sight.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Greater Portent</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint
          a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll
          three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.
        </p>

        <h3>School of Enchantment</h3>
        <p>
          As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability
          to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some
          enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their
          arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who
          magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall
          somewhere in between.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Enchantment Savant</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
          you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is
          halved.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Hypnotic Gaze</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and
          enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action,
          choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the
          target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
          against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end
          of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the
          creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed. On subsequent turns, you
          can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration
          until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move
          more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither
          see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. Once the effect
          ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against
          this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until
          you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Instinctive Charm</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of
          you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
          divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the
          attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against
          your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target
          the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If
          multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to
          target. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the
          attacker again until you finish a long rest. You must choose to use
          this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses.
          Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Split Enchantment</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st
          level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target
          a second creature.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Alter Memories</h4>
        <p>
          At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your
          magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm
          one or more creatures, you can alter one creature’s understanding so
          that it remains unaware of being charmed. Additionally, once before
          the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen
          creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must
          succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save
          DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your
          Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less
          time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your
          enchantment spell.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>School of Transmutation</h3>
        <p>
          You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the
          world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in
          being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and
          learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic
          gives you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge. Some
          transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads
          and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit.
          Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking
          the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Transmutation Savant</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
          you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is
          halved.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Minor Alchemy</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily
          alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it
          from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical
          procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a
          gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different
          one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the
          procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1
          hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were
          concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original
          substance.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Transmuter’s Stone</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter’s
          stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone
          yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of
          your choice as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. When
          you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet</li>
          <li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet</li>
          <li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</li>
          <li>
            Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your
            choice whenever you choose this benefit)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you
          can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If
          you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to
          function.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Shapechanger</h4>
        <p>
          At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is
          not there already. You can cast polymorph without expending a spell
          slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into
          a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower. Once you cast polymorph
          in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long
          rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell
          slot.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Master Transmuter</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve
          of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in a
          single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects.
          Your transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you
          finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Major Transformation</h5>
        <p>
          You can transmute one nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot
          cube—into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of
          equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object
          to transform it.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Panacea</h5>
        <p>
          You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that
          you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all
          its hit points.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Restore Life</h5>
        <p>
          You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the
          transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have
          the spell in your spellbook.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Restore Youth</h5>
        <p>
          You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that
          creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13
          years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.
