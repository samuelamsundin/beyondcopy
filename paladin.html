        <h1>Paladin</h1>
        <p>
          Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and
          grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and
          places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines
          from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide
          with amazement. A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak
          making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band
          celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst
          and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize
          he is there. Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to
          illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes
          like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at
          last his light overcomes its hideous darkness. Whatever their origin
          and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against
          the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness
          of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings,
          or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only
          witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power
          that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>The Cause of Righteousness</h2>
        <p>
          A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with
          the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to
          hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus
          on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by
          the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many
          paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much
          from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god. Paladins
          train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of
          weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the
          magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite
          the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who
          join them in the fight for justice.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Beyond the Mundane Life</h2>
        <p>
          Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life.
          Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for
          a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle
          against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias
          and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true
          calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors
          turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil.
          Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as
          leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is
          first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.
          Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an
          ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose
          than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval
          forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic
          balance away from oblivion.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Paladin</h2>
        <p>
          The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his
          or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath
          don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by
          reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a
          devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a
          holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a
          glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that
          stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from
          traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner
          sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an
          angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? The
          Gods of the Multiverse section lists many deities worshiped by
          paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous,
          Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena,
          Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall. How did you experience your call to serve
          as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while
          you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you
          and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the
          destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps
          you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found
          yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or
          you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s
          life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world
          with that purpose stamped on your soul. As guardians against the
          forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most
          of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your
          alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in
          which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and
          alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards
          of behavior that you have not yet attained.

        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma.
          Second, choose the noble background.

        <h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>
        <p>
          A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even
          the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves
          too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two
          evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to
          transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically
          seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from
          another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an
          all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast
          or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and
          forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates
          his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can
          be more serious. At the DM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might
          be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take
          the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master’s
          Guide.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Class Features</h2>
        <p>As a paladin, you gain the following class features</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Hit Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Hit Dice: 1d10 per paladin level</li>
          <li>Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier</li>
          <li>
            Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution
            modifier per paladin level after 1st
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Armor: All armor, shields</li>
          <li>Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons</li>
          <li>Tools: None</li>
          <li>Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma</li>
          <li>
            Skills: Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine,
            Persuasion, and Religion
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>
          You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
          granted by your background:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>
          <li>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
          <li>(a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
          <li>Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Divine Sense</h3>
        <p>
          The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious
          odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an
          action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the
          end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend,
          or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You
          know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose
          presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von
          Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the
          presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or
          desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can use this feature a
          number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a
          long rest, you regain all expended uses.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Lay on Hands</h3>
        <p>
          Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power
          that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can
          restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.
          As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to
          restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum
          amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit
          points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or
          neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and
          neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands,
          expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no
          effect on undead and constructs.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Fighting Style</h3>
        <p>
          At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose
          one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option
          more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Defense</h4>
        <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Dueling</h4>
        <p>
          When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
          you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Great Weapon Fighting</h4>
        <p>
          When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a
          melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the
          die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or
          versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
        </p>
        <br />Protection<br />
        <p>
          When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is
          within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage
          on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Spellcasting</h3>
        <p>
          By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through
          meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See Spells
          Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for
          the paladin spell list. Preparing and Casting Spells <br />
          The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
          paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or
          higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You
          regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You
          prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast,
          choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number
          of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin
          level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a
          level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a
          5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell
          slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include
          four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
          the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or
          a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list
          of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when
          you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells
          requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per
          spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability <br />
          Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since
          their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use
          your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
          addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw
          DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
          one. <br /><br />
          Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
          <br /><br />
          Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
          modifier <br /><br />
          Spellcasting Focus <br />
          You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
          spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.
        </p>

        <h3>Divine Smite</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon
          attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the
          target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8
          for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than
          1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is
          an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Divine Health</h3>
        <p>
          By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to
          disease.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Sacred Oath</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a
          paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage,
          committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath
          of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from
          another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again
          at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and
          the Channel Divinity feature.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Oath Spells</h3>
        <p>
          Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these
          spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain
          access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells
          don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If
          you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list,
          the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
        <p>
          Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects.
          Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use
          it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to
          use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel
          Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
          When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your
          paladin spell save DC.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
          whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Aura of Protection</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10
          feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to
          the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus
          of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18th level, the
          range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Aura of Courage</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of
          you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the
          range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Improved Divine Smite</h3>
        <p>
          By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your
          melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a
          creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant
          damage.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Cleansing Touch</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on
          yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this
          feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum
          of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Aura Improvements</h3>
        <p>At 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Sacred Oaths</h2>
        <p>
          Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the
          cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The
          final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination
          of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t
          consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level
          and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a
          formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the
          paladin’s heart.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Oath of Devotion</h3>
        <p>
          The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of
          justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights,
          or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in
          shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater
          good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and
          some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same
          standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and
          good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They
          hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and
          incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of
          arms.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Tenets of Devotion</h4>
        <p>
          Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary,
          paladins of this oath share these tenets.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Honesty</h5>
        <p>Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>Courage</h5>
        <p>Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>Compassion</h5>
        <p>
          Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show
          mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Honor</h5>
        <p>
          Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example
          to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of
          harm.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Duty</h5>
        <p>
          Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those
          entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over
          you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
        <p>
          When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two
          Channel Divinity options. <br />
          Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are
          holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1
          minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that
          weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright
          light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the
          weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.
          <br />
          You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If
          you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall
          unconscious, this effect ends. <br />
          Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak
          a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity.
          Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
          must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving
          throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. <br />
          A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
          you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet
          of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only
          the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
          moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
          action.
        </p>

          At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For
          1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim
          light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts
          its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In
          addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws
          against spells cast by fiends or undead. Once you use this feature,
          you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <h3>Oath of Vengeance</h3>
        <p>
          The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have
          committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless
          villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods,
          when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon
          rampages through the countryside — at times like these, paladins arise
          and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong.
          To these paladins — sometimes called avengers or dark knights — their
          own purity is not as important as delivering justice.
        </p>
        <h4>Tenets of Vengeance</h4>
        <p>
          The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the
          tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary.
          Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their
          own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the
          paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core
          principles of the tenets are brutally simple.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Fight the Greater Evil</h5>
        <p>
          Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser
          evil, I choose the greater evil.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>No Mercy for the Wicked</h5>
        <p>Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>By Any Means Necessary</h5>
        <p>My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>Restitution</h5>
        <p>
          If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop
          them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

        <h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
        <p>
          When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two
          Channel Divinity options. <br />
          <br />

          Abjure Enemy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
          prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one
          creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must
          make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened.
          Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed
          save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any
          damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t
          benefit from any bonus to its speed. On a successful save, the
          creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes
          any damage. <br />
          <br />

          Vow of Enmity. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity
          against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your
          Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the
          creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls
          unconscious.
        </p>

        <h4>Relentless Avenger</h4>
        <p>
          By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s
          retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can
          move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of
          the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Soul of Vengeance</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of
          Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under
          the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your
          reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is
          within range.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Avenging Angel</h4>
        <p>
          At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using
          your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the
          following benefits:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
          </li>
          <li>
            You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time
            any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a
            battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
            frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack
            rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a

        <h3>Oathbreaker</h3>
        <p>
          An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to
          pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light
          burned in the paladin’s heart has been extinguished. Only darkness
          remains. A paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to become an
          Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the features specific to his or her
          Sacred Oath with Oathbreaker features.

        <h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
        <p>
          An Oathbreaker paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the following two
          Channel Divinity options. <br /><br />
          Control Undead. As an action, the paladin targets one undead creature
          he or she can see within 30 feet of him or her. The target must make a
          Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the
          paladin’s commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin uses
          this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating
          is equal to or greater than the paladin’s level is immune to this
          effect. <br /><br />
          Dreadful Aspect. As an action, the paladin channels the darkest
          emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each
          creature of the paladin’s choice within 30 feet of the paladin must
          make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed
          save, the target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a
          creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet
          away from the paladin, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to
          end the effect on it.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Aura of Hate</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and undead
          within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus to melee weapon damage
          rolls equal to the paladin’s Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A
          creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a
          time. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Supernatural Resistance</h4>
        <p>
          At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
          and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Dread Lord</h4>
        <p>
          At 20th level, the paladin can, as an action, surround himself or
          herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura
          reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around the paladin to dim
          light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its
          turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, the
          paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura are draped in
          deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on
          attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow. While the aura
          lasts, the paladin can use a bonus action on his or her turn to cause
          the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a
          melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target
          takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + the paladin’s Charisma modifier.
          After activating the aura, the paladin can’t do so again until he or
          she finishes a long rest.
