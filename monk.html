        <h1>Monk</h1>
        <p>
          Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a
          half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed
          ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking
          their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands
          alone. Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a
          battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a
          blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes. Moving with
          the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow
          beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a
          stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped
          scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so
          vulnerable in the grip of sleep. Whatever their discipline, monks are
          united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in
          their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat
          prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy
          infuses all that a monk does.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>The Magic of Ki</h2>
        <p>
          Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic
          traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that
          suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through
          living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create
          magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and
          some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their
          opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength
          into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial
          training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their
          bodies and the bodies of their foes.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Training and Asceticism</h2>
        <p>
          Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny
          refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand
          still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through
          contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as
          children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food
          couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that
          the monks had performed for their families. Some monks live entirely
          apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that
          might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation,
          emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their
          leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power. The
          majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits
          to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and
          other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting
          their neighbors from monsters or tyrants. For a monk, becoming an
          adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a
          wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it
          lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously,
          approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and
          spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and
          are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely
          slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Monk</h2>
        <p>
          As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the
          monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative
          years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s
          threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude
          for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life
          to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic
          life for yourself? Consider why you left. Did the head of your
          monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the
          cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the
          community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is
          there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you
          eager to return to your home? As a result of the structured life of a
          monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks
          are almost always lawful in alignment.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second,
          choose the hermit background.

        </ul>
        <br /><br />

          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>
          You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
          granted by your background:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>(a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon</li>
          <li>(a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
          <li>10 darts</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Unarmored Defense</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not
          wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your
          Wisdom modifier.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
        <p>
          At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of
          combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are
          shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the
          two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while
          you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing
          armor or wielding a shield:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
            rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed
            strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as
            shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk
            weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus
            action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a
            quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action,
            assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For
          example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by
          a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter,
          straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk
          weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the
          Weapons section.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ki</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic
          energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of
          ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have,
          as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend
          these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such
          features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You
          learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you
          spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long
          rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into
          yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to
          regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to
          make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw
          DC is calculated as follows: <br /><br />
          Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
          <br /><br />
          Flurry of Blows <br />
          Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can
          spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
          <br /><br />
          Patient Defense <br />
          You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on
          your turn. <br /><br />
          Step of the Wind <br />
          You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a
          bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the
          turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Unarmored Movement</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are
          not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you
          reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level,
          you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across
          liquids on your turn without falling during the move.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Monastic Tradition</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition:
          the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description
          or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd
          level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Deflect Missiles</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch
          the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do
          so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your
          Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0,
          you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one
          hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in
          this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the
          weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same
          reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your
          weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the
          attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60
          feet.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Slow Fall</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to
          reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times
          your monk level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
          whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Stunning Strike</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an
          opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon
          attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The
          target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until
          the end of your next turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ki-Empowered Strikes</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the
          purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks
          and damage.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Unarmored Movement</h3>
        <p>
          At 6th level, your Unarmored Speed speed bonus increases to 15 feet
          while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Evasion</h3>
        <p>
          At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way
          of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a
          fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
          make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead
          take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half
          damage if you fail.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Stillness of Mind</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on
          yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Unarmored Movement Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and
          across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Purity of Body</h3>
        <p>
          At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you
          immune to disease and poison.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Unarmored Movement</h3>
        <p>
          At 10th level, your Unarmored Speed speed bonus increases to 20 feet
          while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so
          that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that
          can understand a language can understand what you say.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Diamond Soul</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in
          all saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and
          fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second
          result.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Unarmored Movement</h3>
        <p>
          At 14th level, your Unarmored Speed speed bonus increases to 25 feet
          while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Timeless Body</h3>
        <p>
          At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the
          frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die
          of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Empty Body</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points
          to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have
          resistance to all damage but force damage. Additionally, you can spend
          8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing
          material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other
          creatures with you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Unarmored Movement</h3>
        <p>
          At 18th level, your Unarmored Speed speed bonus increases to 30 feet
          while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Perfect Self</h3>
        <p>
          At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points
          remaining, you regain 4 ki points.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Monastic Traditions</h2>
        <p>
          Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries
          scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one
          tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and
          instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All
          three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the
          student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only
          upon reaching 3rd level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Way of the Ascendant Dragon</h3>
        <p>
          The dragon god Bahamut is known to travel the Material Plane in the
          guise of a young monk, and legend says that he founded the first
          monastery of the Way of the Ascendant Dragon in this guise. The
          fundamental teaching of this tradition holds that by emulating
          dragons, a monk becomes a more integrated part of the world and its
          magic. By altering their spirit to resonate with draconic might, monks
          who follow this tradition augment their prowess in battle, bolster
          their allies, and can even soar through the air on draconic wings. But
          all this power is in service of a greater goal: achieving a spiritual
          unity with the essence of the Material Plane. As a follower of the Way
          of the Ascendant Dragon, you decide how you unlocked the power of
          dragons within yourself. The Ascendant Dragon Origin table offers a
          number of possibilities.

        <h4>Draconic Disciple</h4>
        <p>
          3rd-Level Way of the Ascendant Dragon Feature. You can channel
          draconic power to magnify your presence and imbue your unarmed strikes
          with the essence of a dragon’s breath. You gain the following
          benefits: <br /><br />
          Draconic Presence. If you fail a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma
          (Persuasion) check, you can use your reaction to reroll the check, as
          you tap into the mighty presence of dragons. Once this feature turns a
          failure into a success, you can’t use it again until you finish a long
          rest. <br /><br />
          Draconic Strike. When you damage a target with an unarmed strike, you
          can change the damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
          <br /><br />
          Tongue of Dragons. You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one
          other language of your choice.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Breath of the Dragon</h4>
        <p>
          3rd-Level Way of the Ascendant Dragon Feature. You can channel
          destructive waves of energy, like those created by the dragons you
          emulate. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace
          one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in either a
          20-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice).
          Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each
          creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your
          ki save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of
          your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
          successful one. At 11th level, the damage of this feature increases to
          three rolls of your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature a
          number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
          expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses
          available, you can spend 2 ki points to use this feature again.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Wings Unfurled</h4>
        <p>
          6th-Level Way of the Ascendant Dragon Feature. When you use your Step
          of the Wind, you can unfurl spectral draconic wings from your back
          that vanish at the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a
          flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use this feature a
          number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
          expended uses when you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Aspect of the Wyrm</h4>
        <p>
          11th-Level Way of the Ascendant Dragon Feature. The power of your
          draconic spirit now radiates from you, warding your allies or
          inspiring fear in your enemies. As a bonus action, you can create an
          aura of draconic power that radiates 10 feet from you for 1 minute.
          For the duration, you gain one of the following effects of your
          choice: <br /><br />
          Frightful Presence. When you create this aura, and as a bonus action
          on subsequent turns, you can choose a creature within the aura. The
          target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC
          or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the
          saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
          itself on a successful save. <br /><br />
          Once you create this aura, you can’t create it again until you finish
          a long rest, unless you expend 3 ki points to create it again.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Ascendant Dragon</h4>
        <p>
          7th-Level Way of the Ascendant Dragon Feature. Your draconic spirit
          reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits: <br /><br />
          Augment Breath. When you use your Breath of the Dragon, you can spend
          1 ki point to augment its shape and power. The exhalation of draconic
          energy becomes either a 60-foot cone or a 90-foot line that is 5 feet
          wide (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal
          to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as
          much damage on a successful one. <br /><br />
          Blindsight. You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. Within that range, you
          can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if
          you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible
          creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides
          from you. <br /><br />
          Explosive Fury. When you activate your Aspect of the Wyrm, draconic
          fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see in
          your aura. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving
          throw against your ki save DC or take 3d10 acid, cold, fire,
          lightning, or poison damage (your choice).
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Way of the Open Hand</h3>
        <p>
          Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial
          arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push
          and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their
          bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from
          harm.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Open Hand Technique</h4>
        <p>
          Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can
          manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit
          a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows,
          you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
          </li>
          <li>
            It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it
            up to 15 feet away from you.
          </li>
          <li>It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Wholeness of Body</h4>
        <p>
          At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you
          can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must
          finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Tranquility</h4>
        <p>
          Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that
          surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you
          gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of
          your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving
          throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your
          proficiency bonus.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Quivering Palm</h4>
        <p>
          At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in
          someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you
          can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which
          last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are
          harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the
          target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this
          action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it
          fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10
          necrotic damage. You can have only one creature under the effect of
          this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations
          harmlessly without using an action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Way of the Sun Soul</h3>
        <p>
          Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their life energy
          into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock the
          ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the soul of every
          living creature.
        </p>

        <h4>Radiant Sun Bolt</h4>
        <p>
          Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can hurl
          searing bolts of magical radiance. You gain a new attack option that
          you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged
          spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and
          you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its
          damage is radiant, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you
          gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk
          table. When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this
          special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point to make the
          special attack twice as a bonus action. When you gain the Extra Attack
          feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you
          make as part of the Attack action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Searing Arc Strike</h4>
        <p>
          At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into searing
          waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your
          turn, you can spend 2 ki points to cast the burning hands spell as a
          bonus action. You can spend additional ki points to cast burning hands
          as a higher-level spell. Each additional ki point you spend increases
          the spell’s level by 1. The maximum number of ki points (2 plus any
          additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your
          monk level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Searing Sunburst</h4>
        <p>
          At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that
          erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically
          create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where
          it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly
          instant. Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a
          Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature
          doesn’t need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover
          that is opaque. You can increase the sphere’s damage by spending ki
          points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage
          by 2d6.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Sun Shield</h4>
        <p>
          At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura. You
          shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional
          30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action. If
          a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you
          can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The
          radiant damage equals 5 + your Wisdom modifier.
