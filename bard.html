        <h1>Bard</h1>
        <p>
          Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a
          long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge
          springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her
          song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the
          mythic saga it depicts. A stern human warrior bangs his sword
          rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war
          chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic
          of his song fortifies and emboldens them. Laughing as she tunes her
          cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles,
          ensuring that her companions’ words will be well received. Whether
          scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and
          music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create
          illusions, and even heal wounds.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Music and Magic</h2>
        <p>
          In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air,
          but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of
          song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the
          multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave
          it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still
          resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to
          snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and
          powers. The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility.
          Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their
          magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance.
          But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary,
          using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean
          toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells.
          They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural
          aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters
          of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical
          performance to esoteric knowledge.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Learning from Experience</h2>
        <p>
          True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in
          a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering
          the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of
          natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be
          hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards,
          though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across the land gathering
          lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much
          like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of
          musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their
          fellows. Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their
          natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to
          learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring
          career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn,
          practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover
          lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or
          encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness
          their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from
          personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after
          telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many
          bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Bard</h2>
        <p>
          Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your
          character’s background and motivations are not as important as the
          stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and
          mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you
          might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp.
          Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their
          magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration
          of fey or other supernatural creatures. Did you serve an
          apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more
          experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or
          did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced
          your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan,
          befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might
          have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you
          stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical
          gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?

        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity.
          Second, choose the entertainer background. Third, choose the dancing
          lights and vicious mockery cantrips, along with the following
          1st-level spells: charm person, detect magic, healing word, and
          thunderwave.

        <br /><br />
        <h4>Cantrips</h4>
        <p>
          You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You
          learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
          shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellslots</h4>
        <p>
          The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard
          spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
          expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended
          spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the
          1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell
          slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
        <p>
          You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell
          list. The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn
          more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a
          level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For
          instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one
          new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in
          this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace
          it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of
          a level for which you have spell slots.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellcasting ability</h4>
        <p>
          Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic
          comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your
          music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to
          your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
          when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when
          making an attack roll with one.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
          modifier
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
        <p>
          You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the
          ritual tag.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
        <p>
          You can use a musical instrument (see the Tools section) as a
          spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Bardic Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you
          use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than
          yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains
          one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the
          creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability
          check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait
          until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic
          Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll
          succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is
          lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
          You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
          modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you
          finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach
          certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10
          at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Jack of All Trades</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus,
          rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already
          include your proficiency bonus.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Song of Rest</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help
          revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any
          friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at
          the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of
          those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. The extra hit points
          increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th
          level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Bard College</h3>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college
          of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class
          description or another from the Player's Handbook or other sources.
          Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th
          level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency
          bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of
          the chosen proficiencies.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Font of Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended
          uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Countercharm</h3>
        <p>
          At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of
          power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start
          a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that
          time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have
          advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A
          creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The
          performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you
          voluntarily end it (no action required).
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          At 10th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies. Your
          proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
          either of the chosen proficiencies.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Magical Secrets</h3>
        <p>
          By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide
          spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including
          this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown
          on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard
          spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known
          column of the Bard table. You learn two additional spells from any
          classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <h3>Superior Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic
          Inspiration left, you regain one use.

        <br /><br />
        <h2>Bard Colleges</h2>
        <p>
          The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap
          songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their
          knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to
          facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>College of Lore</h3>
        <p>
          Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things,
          collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly
          tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or
          elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to
          hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience
          members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be
          true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their
          loyalty to the king. The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of
          beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets
          of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows
          that the bard would rather be honest than politic. The college’s
          members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete
          with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.
          They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose
          corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of
          authority.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
        <p>
          When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
          with three skills of your choice.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Cutting Words</h4>
        <p>
          Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse,
          and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a
          creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll,
          an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to
          expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic
          Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s
          roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its
          roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability
          check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The
          creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being
          charmed.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Additional Magical Secrets</h4>
        <p>
          At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A
          spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
          table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you
          but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Peerless Skill</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend
          one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add
          the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after
          you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you
          whether you succeed or fail.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>College of Swords</h3>
        <p>
          Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain
          through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as
          sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats.
          Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly
          trained and skilled warriors in their own right. Their talent with
          weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use
          a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination,
          robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing
          justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy
          to accept a blade’s talent for the excitement it adds to a
          performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.
          Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into
          trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A
          blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a
          liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these
          blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves’ guilds or strike
          out on their own as adventurers.

        <h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
        <p>
          When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
          with medium armor and the scimitar. If you’re proficient with a simple
          or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for
          your bard spells.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Fighting Style</h4>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose
          one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option
          more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again.
          <br /><br />
          Dueling <br />
          When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
          you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. <br /><br />
          Two-Weapon Fighting <br />
          When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability
          modifier to the damage of the second attack.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Blade Flourish</h4>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you learn to perform impressive displays of martial
          prowess and speed. Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn,
          your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and
          if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a
          creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of
          your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.
          <br /><br />
          Defensive Flourish. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration
          to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The
          damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You
          also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next
          turn. <br /><br />
          Slashing Flourish. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration
          to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to
          any other creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of
          you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration
          die. <br /><br />
          Mobile Flourish. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to
          cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The
          damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You
          can also push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of
          feet equal to the number you roll on that die. You can then
          immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an
          unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Extra Attack</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
          you take the Attack action on your turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Master’s Flourish</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you
          can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration
          die.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>College of Valor</h3>
        <p>
          Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive
          the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new
          generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great
          bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They
          travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that
          the memory of those events doesn’t pass from the world. With their
          songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment
          as the heroes of old.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
        <p>
          When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
          with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Combat Inspiration</h4>
        <p>
          Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature
          that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add
          the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively,
          when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its
          reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled
          to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before
          knowing whether it hits or misses.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Extra Attack</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
          you take the Attack action on your turn.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Battle Magic</h4>
        <p>
          At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and
          weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to
          cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
