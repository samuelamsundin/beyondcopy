        <h1>Ranger</h1>
        <p>
          Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of
          trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm.
          Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel,
          cutting down one enemy after another. After tumbling away from a cone
          of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose
          an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that
          emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one
          arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick
          scales. Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that
          circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering
          instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking
          and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.
          Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter
          the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the
          dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty
          plains, rangers keep their unending watch.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Deadly Hunters</h2>
        <p>
          Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters
          that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging
          beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They
          learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily
          through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers
          focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful
          against their specific favored foes. Thanks to their familiarity with
          the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness
          nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat
          abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents
          and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of
          protecting the borderlands.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Independent Adventurers</h2>
        <p>
          Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a
          tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of
          civilization from the ravages of monsters that press in from the wild.
          In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with
          druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a
          fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger
          might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense. This fierce
          independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are
          accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath.
          Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the
          hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement,
          frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other
          adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against
          monstrous foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not
          know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they
          make up for it in other ways.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Ranger</h2>
        <p>
          As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the
          training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train
          with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered
          the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your
          mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your
          favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of
          rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as
          well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who
          learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to
          nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds. What’s the
          source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a
          monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did
          you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit
          yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career
          a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a
          significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers?
          Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild,
          or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some
          rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than
          Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.
        </p>

        <p>
          You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
          granted by your background:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>

        <br /><br />
        <h3>Favored Enemy</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying,
          tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. Choose
          a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs,
          dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes,
          plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid
          (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. You have advantage on
          Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on
          Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain
          this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is
          spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose
          one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at
          6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect
          the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Natural Explorer</h3>
        <p>
          You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and
          are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type
          of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland,
          mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or
          Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus
          is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. <br />
          While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain
          the following benefits:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>
          <li>Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>
          <li>
            Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such
            as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal
            pace.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
          </li>
          <li>
            While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number,
            their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Fighting Style</h3>
        <p>
          You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one
          of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more
          than once, even if you later get to choose again.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Archery</h4>
        <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Defense</h4>
        <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 to AC</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Dueling</h4>
        <p>
          When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
          you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>
        <p>
          When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability
          modifier to the damage of the second attack.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Spellcasting</h3>
        <p>
          By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical
          essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See Spells
          Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for
          the ranger spell list. <br /><br />
          Spell Slots <br />
          The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
          ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells,
          you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
          expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you
          know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a
          2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using
          either slot. <br /><br />
          Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher <br />
          You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell
          list. <br /><br />
          The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more
          ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
          for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level
          in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
          <br /><br />
          Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
          of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from
          the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
          have spell slots. <br /><br />
          Spellcasting Ability <br />
          Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your
          magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever
          a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
          Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell
          you cast and when making an attack roll with one. <br /><br />
          Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
          <br /><br />
          Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
        </p>

        <h3>Ranger Archetypes</h3>
        <p>
          The ideal of the ranger has classic expressions. These are detailed
          below.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Beast Master</h4>
        <p>
          The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized
          races and the beasts of the wild. United in focus, beast and ranger
          fight the monsters that threaten civilization and the wilderness
          alike.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Ranger’s Companion</h5>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your
          adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that
          is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or
          lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and
          damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is
          proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in
          its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.
          Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain
          hit points. The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes
          its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command
          the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your
          action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or
          Help action. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge
          action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one
          weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack
          action. If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own,
          focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your
          command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity
          attack. While traveling through your favored terrain with only the
          beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. If the beast dies,
          you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding
          with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the
          requirements.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Exceptional Training</h5>
        <p>
          Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion
          doesn’t attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to
          take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn. In addition, the
          beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming
          resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Bestial Fury</h5>
        <p>
          Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take
          the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the
          Multiattack action if it has that action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Share Spells</h5>
        <p>
          Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you
          can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is
          within 30 feet of you.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Gloom Stalker</h4>
        <p>
          Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the
          earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the
          light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a Gloom
          Stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats
          before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found
          in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the
          shadows.
        </p>

        <h5>Gloom Stalker Magic</h5>
        <p>
          Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach
          certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gloom Stalker Spells
          table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t
          count against the number of ranger spells you know.

        <br /><br />
        <h5>Dread Ambusher</h5>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself
          a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier. At the
          start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases
          by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the
          Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack
          as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra
          1d8 damage of the weapon’s damage type.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Umbral Sight</h5>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you
          already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30
          feet. You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision.
          While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on
          darkvision to see you in that darkness.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Iron Mind</h5>
        <p>
          By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering
          powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If
          you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in
          Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Stalker's Flurry</h5>
        <p>
          At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you
          can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when
          you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as
          part of the same action.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Shadowy Dodge</h5>
        <p>
          Starting at 15th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps
          of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack
          roll against you and doesn’t have advantage on the roll, you can use
          your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature
          before you know the outcome of the attack roll.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Hunter</h4>
        <p>
          Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark
          between the people you protect and the terrors of the wilderness. As
          you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for
          fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres to towering giants
          and terrifying dragons.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Hunter’s Prey</h5>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h6>Colossus Slayer</h6>
        <p>
          Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a
          creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage
          if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage
          only once per turn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h6>Giant Killer</h6>
        <p>
          When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses
          you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature
          immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h6>Horde Breaker</h6>
        <p>
          Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make
          another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that
          is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your
          weapon.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Defensive Tactics</h5>
        <p>
          At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h6>Escape the Horde</h6>
        <p>Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>Multiattack Defense</h6>
        <p>
          When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC
          against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of
          the turn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h6>Steel Will</h6>
        <p>You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Multiattack</h5>
        <p>
          At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h6>Volley</h6>
        <p>
