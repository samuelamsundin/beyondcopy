        <h1>Warlock</h1>
        <p>
          With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden
          robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words
          and bending the palace sentinel to his will. As flames spring to life
          in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic
          patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic. Shifting his gaze
          between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a
          wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway
          to a distant world. Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
          hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with
          mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical
          effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge
          of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities
          of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster
          their own power.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Sworn and Beholden</h2>
        <p>
          A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes
          the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric
          and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are
          not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an
          archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by
          clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that
          between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in
          power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s
          behalf. The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting
          alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in
          darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike
          bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at
          hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how
          to use simple weapons.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Delvers into Secret</h2>
        <p>
          Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power,
          which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This
          thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers
          as well. Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely
          known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish.
          Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful
          tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without
          being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of
          forbidden lore, a brilliant student’s mind is opened to realities
          beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the
          outer void. Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and
          power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a
          pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the
          power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their
          days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind
          of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive
          warlocks toward adventure.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Warlcok</h2>
        <p>
          As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about
          your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What
          led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your
          patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out
          the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder
          god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and
          choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve
          joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you? Work with
          your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your
          character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you
          into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you
          can do between adventures. What kind of relationship do you have with
          your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How
          important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play
          in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron? How
          does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it
          might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find
          messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves,
          or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see.
          Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking
          visions, or deal only with intermediaries.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by
          Constitution. Second, choose the charlatan background. Third, choose
          the eldritch blast and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-level
          spells charm person and witch bolt.
        </p>

        <br /><br />
        <h3>Otherwordly Patron</h3>
        <p>
          At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of
          your choice: the Fiend, which is detailed at the end of the class
          description, or one from another source. Your choice grants you
          features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Pact Magic</h3>
        <p>
          Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have
          given you facility with spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules
          of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the warlock spell list.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spell Table</h4>
        <table></table>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Cantrips</h4>
        <p>
          You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You
          learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
          shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
        <p>
          The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
          warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the
          level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level.
          To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must
          expend a spell slot. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots
          when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th
          level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell
          witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a
          3rd-level spell.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
        <p>
          At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
          warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows
          when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and
          higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s
          shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach
          6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be
          1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this
          class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace
          it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be
          of a level for which you have spell slots.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
        <p>
          Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you
          use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
          ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the
          saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack
          roll with one. <br /><br />

          Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
          <br /><br />

          Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
          modifier <br /><br />

          Spellcasting Focus <br />
          You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
          spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Eldritch Invocations</h3>
        <p>
          In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations,
          fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding
          magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of
          your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the
          class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain
          additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations
          Known column of the Warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level
          in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and
          replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.
          If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to
          learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet
          its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this
          class.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Agonizing Blast</h4>
        <p>
          Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip <br />

          When you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage
          it deals on a hit.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Armor of Shadows</h4>
        <p>
          You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell
          slot or material components.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Ascendant Step</h4>
        <p>
          Prerequisite: 9th level <br />
          You can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell
          slot or material components.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Aspect of the Moon</h4>
        <p>
          Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature <br />
          You no longer need to sleep and can’t be forced to sleep by any means.
          To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing
          light activity, such as reading your Book of Shadows and keeping
          watch.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Beast Speech</h4>
        <p>

          slot.
        </p>

        <h4>Beguilling Influence</h4>
        <p>You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Bewitching Whispers</h4>
        <p>
          Prerequisite: 7th level <br />

          You can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do
          so again until you finish a long rest.

        <h4>Book of Ancient Secrets</h4>
        <p>
          Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature <br />
          You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose
          two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell
          list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the
          book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your
          Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals.
          You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned
          them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know
          as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. On your adventures, you can add
          other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a
          spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or
          less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare
          the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the
          transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks
          needed to inscribe it.

        <p>
          Prerequisite: 5th level <br />

          As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that
          looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every
          direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you’re
          incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action. The aura grants you
          advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks but disadvantage on all
          other Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the
          aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0
          damage). Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until

        <h4>Gaze of Two Minds</h4>
        <p>
          You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive
          through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the
          creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your
          action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the
          duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the
          other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed
          by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own
          surroundings.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

          already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your
          concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During
          that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images. Once
          you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a
          short or long rest.

          as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. In addition, the

          magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls. Finally, the
          weapon you conjure can be a shortbow, longbow, light crossbow, or
          heavy crossbow.

          damage to the cursed target and each creature of your choice that you
          can see within 5 feet of it. The psychic damage equals your Charisma
          modifier (minimum of 1 damage). To use this invocation, you must be

        <h3>Pact Boon</h3>
        <p>
          At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for
          your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your
          choice.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Pact of the Blade</h4>
        <p>
          You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand.
          You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you
          create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon
          counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
          immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears
          if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also
          disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon
          (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic
          weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you
          hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour,
          which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the
          weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears
          whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an
          artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being
          your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a
          different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to
          it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional
          space when the bond breaks.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Pact of the Chain</h4>
        <p>
          You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The
          spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. When you cast
          the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or
          one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or
          sprite. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo
          one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with
          its reaction.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Pact of the Tome</h4>
        <p>
          Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you
          gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list
          (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your
          person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against
          your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock
          spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose
          your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a
          replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a
          short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns
          to ash when you die.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Mystic Arcanum (6th level)</h3>
        <p>
          At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an
          arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as
          this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a
          spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At
          higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be
          cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level
          spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain
          all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

        <h3>Mystic Arcanum (7th level)</h3>
        <p>
          At 13th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an
          arcanum. Choose one 7th-level spell from the warlock spell list as
          this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a
          spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At
          higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be
          cast in this way: one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level
          spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when
          you finish a long rest.
        </p>

        <h3>Mystic Arcanum (8th level)</h3>
        <p>
          At 15th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an
          arcanum. Choose one 8th-level spell from the warlock spell list as
          this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a
          spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At
          17th level, you gain a 9th-level warlock spell of your choice that can
          be cast in this way. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when
          you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Mystic Arcanum (9th level)</h3>
        <p>
          At 17th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an
          arcanum. Choose one 9th-level spell from the warlock spell list as
          this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a
          spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
          You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long
          rest.

        <br /><br />
        <h3>Eldritch Master</h3>
        <p>
          At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power
          while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can
          spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your
          expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain
          spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you
          can do so again.
        </p>

        <h2>Otherwordly Patrons</h2>
        <p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>The Archfey</h3>
        <p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Expended Spell List</h4>
        <p>The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h4>Fey Presence</h4>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Misty Step</h4>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Beguiling Defenses</h4>
        <p>Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Dark Delirium</h4>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage. Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion. You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>The Celestial</h3>
        <p>Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, ki-rin, unicorn, or other entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse. Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among mortals for now, and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h4>Bonus Cantrips</h4>
        <p>At 1st level, you learn the light and sacred flame cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Healing Light</h4>
        <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level. As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total. Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Radiant Soul</h4>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Celestial Resilience</h4>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Searing Vengeance</h4>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>The Hexblade</h3>
        <p>You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell — a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting. Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h4>Hexblade’s Curse</h4>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:</p>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.</li>
          <li>Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>
          <li>If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Hex Warrior</h4>
        <p>At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon’s type.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Accursed Specter</h4>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife. Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can’t use the feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Armor of Hexes</h4>
        <p>At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Master of Hexes</h4>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade’s Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren’t incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don’t regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.</p>
