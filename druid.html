        <h1>Druid</h1>
        <p>
          Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the
          fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite
          the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest. Crouching out of
          sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers
          out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil
          Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.
          Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass
          of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the
          foul creatures the mocking semblance of life. Whether calling on the
          elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal
          world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and
          fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves
          as extensions of nature’s indomitable will.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Power of Nature</h2>
        <p>
          Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical
          powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity.
          Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with
          nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve
          gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic
          traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the
          worship of gods in temples and shrines. Druid spells are oriented
          toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and
          moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on
          animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this
          practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their
          natural form.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Preserve the Balance</h2>
        <p>
          For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements
          that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in
          equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the
          world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and
          broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of
          Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of
          others. Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance
          that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for people to live
          in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that
          which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural,
          including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead
          (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against
          such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’
          territory. Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching
          over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger
          arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids
          take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Creating a Druid</h2>
        <p>
          When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond
          with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old
          Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in
          the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic
          encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant
          eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character
          was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was
          interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your
          character’s destiny. Have you always been an adventurer as part of
          your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a
          sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil,
          and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or
          purpose.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>
          You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First,
          Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.
          Second, choose the hermit background.
        </p>

        <h3>Sacred Plants and Wood</h3>
        <p>
          A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash,
          birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow,
          and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus,
          incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. Similarly,
          a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and
          shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles
          for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated
          with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or
          whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields.
          Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons,
          such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants
          described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For
          instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and
          cactus plants.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>
        <p>
          Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids
          are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the
          multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such
          deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more
          ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In
          fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old
          Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers,
          and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the
          worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also
          encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as
          devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa. In the worlds of Greyhawk and
          the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the
          faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten
          Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus,
          Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos,
          Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the
          First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them
          all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration. The druids of
          Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign
          Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They
          believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun,
          moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells,
          then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits.
          Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the
          proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces
          of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic
          is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the
          forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant
          to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.

        <h4>Cantrips</h4>
        <p>
          At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid
          spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at
          higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid
          table.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
        <p>
          The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid
          spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you
          must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
          expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list
          of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the
          druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells
          equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one
          spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
          For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and
          two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared
          spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.
          If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
          a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it
          from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of
          prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of
          druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
          minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
        <p>
          Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your
          magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your
          Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
          addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
          DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
          <br /><br />
          Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
          <br /><br />
          Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
          <br /><br />
          Ritual Casting <br />
          You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
          tag and you have the spell prepared. <br /><br />
          Spellcasting Focus <br />
          You can use a druidic focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
          spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Wild Shape</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the
          shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature
          twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
          Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as
          shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can
          transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower
          that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.
        </p>

        </table>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your
          druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless
          you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal
          form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically
          revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While
          you are transformed, the following rules apply:
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast,
            but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence,
            Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and
            saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the
            creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the
            bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s
            bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair
            actions, you can’t use them.
          </li>
          <br /><br />
          <li>
            When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice.
            When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
            points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a
            result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over
            to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal
            form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.
            As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0
            hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
          </li>
          <br /><br />
          <li>
            You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action
            that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast
            form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell
            you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions
            that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve
            already cast.
          </li>
          <br /><br />
          <li>
            You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or
            other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable
            of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such
            as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
          </li>
          <br /><br />
          <li>
            You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,
            merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment
            functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for
            the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s
            shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match
            the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must
            either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges
            with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Druid Circle</h3>
        <p>
          At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the
          Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one
          from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you
          features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Wild Shape Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of
          a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
          that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You
          regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
          level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
          can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
          can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the
          optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat
          of your choice instead.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Wild Shape Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          At 8th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of
          a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1 or lower. You
          can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a
          short or long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Timeless Body</h3>
        <p>
          Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to
          age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1
          year.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Beast Spells</h3>
        <p>
          Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any
          shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and
          verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you
          aren’t able to provide material components.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Archdruid</h3>
        <p>
          At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of
          times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components
          of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a
          cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both
          your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Druid Circles</h2>
        <p>
          Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are
          part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All
          druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some
          individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking
          members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids
          recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the
          wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on
          each other. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that
          share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the
          druid.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Circle of Dreams</h3>
        <p>
          Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that
          have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids’
          guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between
          them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with
          dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast
          hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places,
          where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find
          rest.

        <h4>Balm of the Summer Court</h4>
        <p>
          At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer
          Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You
          have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your
          druid level. As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can
          see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to
          half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them
          together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the
          total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent. You
          regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow</h4>
        <p>
          At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long
          rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help
          guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in
          space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears,
          centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere. While within
          the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth)
          and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the
          sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it.
          The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the
          sphere.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Hidden Paths</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that
          some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus
          action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied
          space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport
          one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space
          you can see. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
          Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of
          it when you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Walker in Dreams</h4>
        <p>
          At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to
          travel mentally or physically through dreamlands. When you finish a
          short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without
          expending a spell slot or requiring material components: dream (with
          you as the messenger), scrying, or teleportation circle. This use of
          teleportation circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a
          permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location
          where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If
          you haven’t taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails
          but isn’t wasted. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
          until you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Circle of Spores</h3>
        <p>
          Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within
          mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into
          abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that
          life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the
          other and then back again. Death isn’t the end of life, but instead a
          change of state that sees life shift into a new form. Druids of this
          circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other
          druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they
          consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe
          that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is
          vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with
          undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the
          cycle and must be thwarted.

        <h4>Circle Spells</h4>
        <p>
          2nd-level Circle of Spores feature. Your symbiotic link to fungi and
          your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access
          to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill touch cantrip. At
          3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for
          that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access
          to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t
          count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you
          gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list,
          the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

        <h4>Halo of Spores</h4>
        <p>
          2nd-level Circle of Spores feature. You are surrounded by invisible,
          necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature
          nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet
          of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4
          necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution
          saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases
          to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Symbiotic Entity</h4>
        <p>
          2nd-level Circle of Spores feature. You gain the ability to channel
          magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your
          Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming
          into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level
          you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the
          following benefits:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a
            second time and add it to the total.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any
            target they hit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary
          hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Fungal Infestation</h4>
        <p>
          6th-level Circle of Spores feature. Your spores gain the ability to
          infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small
          or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to
          animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The
          creature uses the zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains
          animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies. In combat,
          the zombie’s turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental
          commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making
          one melee attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to
          your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended
          uses of it when you finish a long rest.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Spreading Spores</h4>
        <p>
          10th-level Circle of Spores feature. You gain the ability to seed an
          area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity
          feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they
          swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if
          you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or
          if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active. Whenever a
          creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature
          takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a
          Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can
          take this damage no more than once per turn. While the cube of spores
          persists, you can’t use your Halo of Spores reaction.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Fungal Body</h4>
        <p>
          14th-level Circle of Spores feature The fungal spores in your body
          alter you: you can’t be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned,
          and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead,
          unless you’re incapacitated.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Circle of the Moon</h3>
        <p>
          Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds.
          Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade
          warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they
          might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid
          creature, let alone another druid. Changeable as the moon, a druid of
          this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the
          treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth
          in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the
          druid’s blood.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Combat Wild Shape</h4>
        <p>
          When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use
          Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.
          Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a
          bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per
          level of the spell slot expended.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Circle forms</h4>
        <p>
          The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more
          dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild
          Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1
          (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must
          abide by the other limitations there). Starting at 6th level, you can
          transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid
          level divided by 3, rounded down.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Primal Strike</h4>
        <p>
          Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for
          the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
          attacks and damage.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Circle Forms</h4>
        <p>
          The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more
          dangerous animal forms. Starting at 6th level, you can transform into
          a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by
          3, rounded down.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Elemental Wild Shape</h4>
        <p>
          At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time
          to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire
          elemental, or a water elemental.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Thousand Forms</h4>
        <p>
          By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical
          form in more subtle ways. You can cast the alter self spell at will.
